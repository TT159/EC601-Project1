# EC601_Project_1
This is a project of course EC601. 
I choose the topic: RSNA-MICCAI Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification.

## Problem Statement
### What does the topic cover?
This topic covers data science, intelligent systems and biomedical science. We need to use these technologies to solve a biomedical problem, named brain tumor. Malignant tumors of the brain are a life-threatening disease, and glioblastoma is the hardest of them all. From the relevant description in Kaggle, we can get some knowledge of biological sciences.
> Glioblastoma is the most common brain cancer in adults and the one with the worst prognosis, with a median survival time of less than one year. The presence of a specific gene sequence called MGMT promoter methylation in tumors has been shown to be a favorable prognostic factor and a powerful predictor of responsiveness to chemotherapy.</br>

In order to solve this problem, we are asked to use MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to predict glioblastoma genotypes to train and test your model, so that we can detect the presence of MGMT promoter methylation. Therefore, how to classify and recognize the status of brain tumor images is the key point.

### Why it is important?
Glioblastoma (GBM), and diffuse astrocytic glioma with molecular features of GBM, are the most common and aggressive malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) in adults, with extreme intrinsic heterogeneity in appearance, shape, and histology [1]. GBM patients have an average prognosis of 14 months, following standard of care treatment, and 4 months left untreated [8].


Thus, in this case, we intend to use data science and machine learning technology to predict cancer genetics.
